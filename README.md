# Hi there I'm David Perlow 
> ###### What's up! 
> After 9 years as a teacher I am taking the plunge into the world of `Hi-Tech`. It all started when the Corona pushed all of us teachers into the unfamiliar world of online teaching. Suddenly my curioisity in technology, computers and advancing myself led me to where I am today. So I am starting a new chapter in my life and that's what I've learned, don't be afraid to pull the trigger, even if it's small steps.
