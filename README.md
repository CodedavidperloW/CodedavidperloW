# Hi there I'm David Perlow 👋🎧🎼***🇩🇯 326**🎼*🎧👋
> ###### What's up! 
> After 9 years as a educator I am taking the plunge into the world of Hi-Tech. It all started when the Corona pushed all of us teachers into the unfamiliar world of online teaching. Suddenly my curioisity in technology, computers and advancing myself led me to where I am today. So I am starting a new chapter in my life and that's what I've learned, don't be afraid to pull the trigger, even if it's small steps. 


- 🔭 I’m currently working on becoming a ***new developer*** 👨🏻‍💻
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bootcamp course through #### Developers Institute #### 🧑‍💻
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects to use my skills **working as a team** 🎖️
- 🤔 I’m ***looking for help*** with finding my niche within the Hi-Tech world 🤝🏽

>#### So now this year I am taking a Shabbaton from teaching to focus on this transition
